[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/0hh34xqxu286ratc?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/lsmithmier/dissectpecoffbinary) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/lsmithmier/DissectPECOFFBinary/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/lsmithmier/DissectPECOFFBinary)
## The What
Today you can build executables that are written in C# on many 
different platforms.  You can build them using many different 
Frameworks. 

## The Why
Does it matter if the executables generated by different methods 
are identical?  Should we care if there are minor differences 
between libraries created in different frameworks if they do the 
same work?  Just within vanilla VS 2015, you have the option of 
10 different frameworks.

What about applications built using Mono on a Mac or Linux?  What 
difference does it make if you build your application from the 
command line?  And that doesn’t get into the whole .NET Core 
discussion. 

## The How
This is the Source Code location for DissectPECOFFBinary application. 
It pulls apart the binary file and displays the parts for all to see.

## The Where
Please see [Dissecting C# 
Executables](http://www.csharp4u.com/2017/01/dissecting-c-executables.html) 
for a discussion of the different parts of a C# executable
and the [C# For 
You](http://www.csharp4u.com/search/label/DissectPCOFFBinary) 
blog for the latest posts on the application.
